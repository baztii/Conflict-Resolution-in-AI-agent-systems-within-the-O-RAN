Notes1:
    -> The test1 shows that there is something wrong with the formulas because the total throughput does not depend of the power given to the RBG's
    -> On the other hand, using the ONL is inefficient when dealing many data and it's not factible to use it in the near-RT RIC
    
Notes2:
    -> The RBGs are allocated always to the user with the most pending data (to maximize the R^n,m)
    -> If we force the C < L, the solver gives all RBGs the max power
    -> It seems not to depend of the power in the case where L < C

Notes3:
    -> The noise ratio affects the capacity in a way that the bigger the noise is the bigger the capacity is!!!
    

Future Work:
    * Solve the problem using DQN (Deep Q-Network), i.e. a RL algorithm
