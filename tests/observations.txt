Notes1:
    -> The test1 shows that there is something wrong with the formulas because the total throughput does not depend of the power given to the RBG's
    -> On the other hand, using the ONL is inefficient when dealing many data and it's not factible to use it in the near-RT RIC
    
Notes2:
    -> The RBGs are allocated always to the same user
    -> I found a better throughput  
    -> Sometimes it does not work

Future Work:
    * Solve the problem using DQN (Deep Q-Network), i.e. a RL algorithm
